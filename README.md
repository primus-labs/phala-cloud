- [**Armor Crypto**](https://github.com/HashWarlock/armor-crypto-mcp/tree/phala-mcp) - A single source for integrating AI Agents with the Crypto ecosystem. This includes Wallet creation and management, swaps, transfers, event-based trades like DCA, stop loss and take profit, and much more. The Armor MCP supports Solana in Alpha and, when in beta, will support more than a dozen blockchains, including Ethereum. Base, Avalanche, Bitcoin, Sui, Berachain, megaETH, Optimism, Ton, BNB, and Arbitrum, among others. Using Armor's MCP you can bring all of crypto into your AI Agent with unified logic and a complete set of tools. *by Armor Crypto*
- [**Moralis MCP**](https://github.com/HashWarlock/moralis-mcp-server) - The Moralis MCP Server is a local or cloud-deployable engine that connects natural language prompts to real blockchain insights — allowing AI models to query wallet activity, token metrics, dapp usage, and more without custom code or SQL. *by Moralis*
- [**Zep Graphiti MCP**](https://github.com/HashWarlock/graphiti/tree/main/mcp_server) - The [Zep Graphiti MCP Server](https://www.getzep.com/product/knowledge-graph-mcp/) is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications. **by Zep**
