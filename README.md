## Use Phala Cloud

It's easy to deploy arbitrary dockerized applications on Phala Cloud. Check the [documentation](https://docs.phala.network/overview/phala-network/phala-cloud) for more information.

Phala Cloud is built on top of [dstack](https://github.com/dstack-TEE/dstack/). To simulate the TEE-specific features, you can use the [tappd simulator](https://github.com/leechael/tappd-simulator/). There are several starter templates available that you can check out to learn more:

- Phala Cloud Python Starter, with FastAPI: https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-cloud-python-starter
- Phala Cloud Bun Starter, using Bun + TypeScript: https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-cloud-bun-starter
- Phala Cloud NextJS Starter: https://github.com/Phala-Network/nextjs-viem-tee-sim-template

If you want to integrate the SDK into your existing apps, here are the SDKs we currently have:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phala/dstack-sdk
- Python: https://pypi.org/project/dstack-sdk/
- Golang: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/sdk/go/tappd
